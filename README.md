# BTS Sizing Tool

The BTS Sizing Tool is a graphical user interface application built using Python's Tkinter library. It helps in sizing the BTS (Base Transceiver Station) equipment by calculating various parameters such as total site area, power demand, solar panel sizing, and battery sizing.

## Features
- **Step-by-step Navigation**: The application is divided into multiple steps, guiding the user through each phase of the sizing process.
- **Input Validation**: Input fields are validated to ensure that only valid numerical inputs are accepted.
- **Calculation Results**: The tool provides real-time calculation results for each step, aiding in quick decision-making.
- **Customization**: Users can input site dimensions, power demand, solar hours, and other parameters to customize the sizing process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install Python on your system if not already installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Run the application by executing the command `python app.py`.

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running the script.
2. Enter the required information in each step:
   - Step 1: Input site dimensions (length and width).
   - Step 2: Input solar installation dimensions (length and width).
   - Step 3: Input power demand.
   - Step 4: Input solar panel size, rating, and sun hours.
   - Step 5: Input grid unavailability and battery DoD (Depth of Discharge).
3. Click the "Calculate" button to see the results for each step.
4. Use the "Cancel" button to clear the input fields.
5. Navigate between steps using the menu on the left side.
